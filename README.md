first_stars
===========

Code resources for simulations of the First Stars and Galaxies using the FLASH hydrodynamics code.

GalacticOutflow/ provides code to setup and run a simulation of galactic outflows powered by supernovae.

KernelSmooth/ maps discrete point particles onto an adaptive mesh using an SPH kernel (e.g. Gadget-2).

PhotoChem/ calculates photoionization and metal cooling rates in FLASH.

prolong_particles/ maps dark matter particles directly onto an adaptive mesh at multiple levels of refinement.
